# Side Panel Error Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis
The error "No active side panel for tabId: 1663100466" occurred because:

1. **Uncontrolled Message Sending**: The background script was sending messages to the side panel without checking if it was open/active
2. **Missing Error Handling**: Several API calls lacked proper try-catch blocks
3. **No State Tracking**: The extension didn't track whether the side panel was actually open or closed
4. **Aggressive Side Panel Management**: Trying to manipulate side panel state on inactive tabs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Side Panel State Tracking
- Added `sidePanelInitialized` flag to track if side panel is active
- Added `isSidePanelActive()` helper function
- Added message handling for `sidePanel_closed` events

### 2. Safe Message Sending
- Created `safeSendToSidePanel()` function with proper error handling
- Replaced all direct `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` calls with the safe wrapper
- Added state checks before sending messages

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Wrapped all side panel API calls in try-catch blocks
- Added detailed error logging
- Graceful degradation when side panel is unavailable

### 4. Side Panel Lifecycle Management
- Added `beforeunload` and `visibilitychange` event listeners in sidepanel.js
- Proper notification to background script when side panel closes
- State cleanup when side panel becomes inactive

### 5. Improved URL Validation
- Enhanced tab switching logic to only enable side panel on valid Tencent Docs URLs
- Better handling of navigation events
- Reduced unnecessary API calls

## Key Changes

### background.js:
- Line 7-27: Added helper functions for state tracking and safe messaging
- Line 115-159: Enhanced initialization and close handling
- Line 173-182: Safe accessibility mode updates
- Line 281-295: Conditional content sending based on side panel state

### sidepanel.js:
- Line 2180-2198: Added page lifecycle event listeners

## Expected Results
- No more "No active side panel" errors
- Messages only sent when side panel is actually open
- Graceful handling of side panel close/open cycles
- Better user experience with proper state management
